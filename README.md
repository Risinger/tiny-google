#Tiny Google

## Disclaimer
This project was written in a single week (and finals week, at that). Please excuse any lack of comments or untidy code. 

## Description
This is the final project for CS1699: Cloud Computing. 
It reads in text files and creates and inverted index using either MapReduce or Spark. 
The UI then enables the user to select between the inverted indexes and retrieve results for specific query terms. 

## Dependencies
TinyGoogle requires hadoop and spark installations. The scala (spark) portion also uses sbt to build.
